# Unit 2 - Store Management Project

## Introduction

You are opening a new business in your community! Businesses often need programs to manage the products and services they offer and track orders and requests from customers. Your goal is to create a store management system for your business.

## Requirements

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming and class structure and design to create your store management system:
- **Create a class hierarchy** – Develop a superclass that represents a product or service your business offers and one or more subclasses that extend the superclass to represent more specific types of products or services.
- **Declare instance variables** – Declare instance variables in the superclass that are shared with the subclasses and instance variables in the subclasses that are not shared with the superclass.
- **Write constructors** – Write no-argument and parameterized constructors in the superclass and subclasses. Subclass constructors use the super keyword to call the superclass constructor.
- **Implement accessor and mutator methods** – Write accessor and mutator methods for instance variables that should be accessible and/or modifiable from outside of the class.
- **Implement a toString() method** – Write toString() methods in the superclass and subclasses that return information about the state of an object.

## Description

In this project, I decided to create a program that displays the food item that people would normally get at Chipotle. Chipotle is a fast food resturant that specializes in Tex-Mex meals. I chose this topic because I really enjoy eating Chipotle, it's one of my favorite meals. For my program, I created accessor and mutator methods that allow my porgram to print out the information that user needs. For instance, my mutator method included a boolean that determined whether the burrito bowl included cheese or not. This program is used to inform the reader how much a burrito bowl would cost if there was cheese in it. When clicked "start" the name of the food item, price, and whether it has cheese or not will be displayed in the console log for the user to see.
